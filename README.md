Internship at OasisInfobyte

Hello all,
    I am glad that i got an internship opportunity to work as an intern in the domain DataScience at OASISINFOBYTE. Here I will be doing tasks related to data science using python.
	During my internship, I have the chance to work on real-world data science projects and gain hands-on experience in the data collection, analysis and model development.
	Data science is an ever-evolving field that has a profound impact on industries across the board. It empowers organizations to harness the power of data to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and drive innovation.

# Task-1: Iris Flower Classification

The Iris flower classification problem is a classic machine learning and data analysis task that involves categorizing Iris flowers into one of three species based on certain measurements of the flower's sepals and petals. This dataset is often used as a beginner's dataset to practice and understand various machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques.

Here First we applied Linear Regression to find the relation between Petal_Length and Petal_Width and visualized all the correlations between them using HeatMap.

As the correlation between Petal_Length and Petal_Width is higher we applied Logistic Regression and also compared it with Sepal_Length and Sepal_Width. Accuracy is more with Petal_Length and Petal_Width.

Trained it with Decision Tree Classification and also got same results.
