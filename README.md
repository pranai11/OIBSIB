Internship at OasisInfobyte

Hello all,
    I am glad that i got an internship opportunity to work as an intern in the domain DataScience at OASISINFOBYTE. Here I will be doing tasks related to data science using python.
	During my internship, I have the chance to work on real-world data science projects and gain hands-on experience in the data collection, analysis and model development.
	Data science is an ever-evolving field that has a profound impact on industries across the board. It empowers organizations to harness the power of data to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and drive innovation.

# Task-1: Iris Flower Classification

The Iris flower classification problem is a classic machine learning and data analysis task that involves categorizing Iris flowers into one of three species based on certain measurements of the flower's sepals and petals. This dataset is often used as a beginner's dataset to practice and understand various machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques.

Here First we applied Linear Regression to find the relation between Petal_Length and Petal_Width and visualized all the correlations between them using HeatMap.

As the correlation between Petal_Length and Petal_Width is higher we applied Logistic Regression and also compared it with Sepal_Length and Sepal_Width. Accuracy is more with Petal_Length and Petal_Width.

Trained it with Decision Tree Classification and also got same results.

# Task-2: Car Price Prediction

Car price prediction refers to the use of statistical and machine learning models to estimate the selling price of automobiles. It is a critical task in the automotive industry, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions. This prediction relies on various factors, including the car's specifications, market trends, and historical data.

Here we used Random Forest Machine Learning Algorithm as the data set contains various dataitems of different categories.

We had used pandas dummies to replace the string data items with integers and applied randomforest algorithm and findout the accuracy using some tools like mean suared error, mean absolute error and r2_score.

# Task-3: Sales Prediction

Sales prediction is a crucial aspect of any business, as it enables companies to make informed decisions regarding marketing strategies, resource allocation, and revenue forecasting. In this analysis, we use historical data on advertising budgets for TV, Radio, and Newspaper to predict product sales. We employ machine learning techniques to build models that can provide accurate sales predictions.

Here we used Linear Regression Models for individual data items like Newspaper vs Sales and TV vs Sales etc. Next we applied RandomForest and LogisticRegression which lead us to great results with best accuracy than LinearRegression models.

As evaluation metrics we used mean square error and r2_score.
